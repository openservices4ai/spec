# Specification of services plugged in AI models
> Most of the content in this file generated by ChatGPT

This repository contains documentation and specifications for a variety of services that can be integrated into AI models. These services provide real-time information and functionality that trained models cannot learn on their own. The goal of this repository is to make it easier for developers and AI practitioners to incorporate these services into their projects and workflows. By providing a comprehensive set of specifications, this repository aims to streamline the integration process and promote the use of services in AI.

A community-driven repository for sharing feedback, suggestions, and contributions. **Participation is welcome.**


## What is an AI-integrated sevice

As AI models trained on a fixed set of data and cannot learn something new in real-time while serving, services integrated in AI models help provide real-time information and services. For example, a chatbot model may be integrated with a todo list service to help users add/remove todos, or create a timer. 

This is why services needed for the current AI models.


## Why need an unified service specification for AI

First, it can help improve compatibility between different AI platforms, making it easier for developers to integrate various plugins into their AIs. This can save time and resources for developers who would otherwise have to manually modify each plugin to work with their chatbot.

Second, an unified specification can help ensure that services adhere to certain standards for functionality, security, and user privacy. This can help promote trust and confidence among users who interact with chatbots using these services.

Finally, it can also help promote innovation and collaboration among developers working on AI chatbots. By providing a common framework for plugin development, developers can more easily share their work and collaborate on new features and functionalities, ultimately leading to better and more sophisticated chatbots for users.
